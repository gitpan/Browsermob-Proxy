=head1 NAME

Browsermob::Server - Perl client to control the Browsermob Proxy server

=head1 VERSION

version 0.06

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $server = Browsermob::Server->new(
        path => '/opt/browsermob-proxy-2.0-beta-9/bin/browsermob-proxy'
    );
    $server->start;             # ignore if your server is already started

    my $proxy = $server->create_proxy;
    my $port = $proxy->port;

    $proxy->new_har;

    # generate traffic across your port
    `curl -x http://localhost:$port http://www.google.com > /dev/null 2>&1`;

    print Dumper $proxy->har;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a way to control the Browsermob Proxy server
within Perl. There are only a few public methods for starting and
stopping the server. You also have the option of instantiating a
server object and pointing it towards an existing BMP server on
localhost, and just using it to avoid having to pass the server_port
arg when instantiating new proxies.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 path

The path to the browsermob_proxy binary. If you aren't planning to
call C<start>, this is optional.

=head2 server_addr

The address of the remote server where the Browsermob Proxy server is
running. This defaults to localhost.

=head2 port

The port on which the proxy server should run. This is not the port
that you should have other clients connect.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 start

Start a browsermob proxy on C<port>. Starting the server does not create
any proxies.

=head2 stop

Stop the forked browsermob-proxy server. This does not work all the
time, although the server seems to get GC'd all on its own, even after
ignoring a C<SIGTERM>.

=head2 create_proxy

After starting the server, or connecting to an existing one, use
C<create_proxy> to get a proxy that you can use with your tests. No
proxies actually exist until you call create_proxy; starting the
server does not create a proxy.

    my $proxy = $bmp->create_proxy; # returns a Browsermob::Proxy object
    my $proxy = $bmp->create_proxy(port => 1337);

=head2 get_proxies

Get a list of currently registered proxies.

    my $proxy_aref = $bmp->get_proxies->{proxyList};
    print scalar @$proxy_aref;

=head2 find_open_port

Given a range of valid ports, finds the lowest unused port.

    my $unused_port = $bmp->find_open_port;
    my $proxy = $bmp->create_proxy(port => $unused_port);
